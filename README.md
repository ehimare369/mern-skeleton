# mern-skeleton
This is a skeleton a application, but with fully functioning MERN web application with user create , read,Â  update, delete ( CRUD), and authentication-authorization ( auth) capabilities.

In the skeleton application, we will add the following use cases
with user CRUD and auth functionality implementations:
**Sign up:** Users can register by creating a new account
using an email address.

**User list:** Any visitor can see a list of all registered users.
Authentication: Registered users can sign-in and sign-out.

**Protected user profile**: Only registered users can view
individual user details after signing in.

**Authorized user edit and delete:** Only a registered and
authenticated user can edit or remove their own user
account details.

In summary this simple working web
application supports user accounts.
